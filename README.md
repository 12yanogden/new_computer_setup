# new_computer_setup
Installs all programs and functionalities that I prefer to have on a new computer. Primarily services MacOS, but hopefully will expand to be cross-platform.

Install Steps
1. Install XCode
   1. If on a VM, go to https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode
2. Install XCode Command Line Tools

3. Run setup_shell_env.sh
4. Run install_apps.sh
5. [Run install_apps.sh](./install_apps.sh)
6. Create .hushlogin to remove the "Last login" message whenever the terminal starts. (touch ~/.hushlogin)
